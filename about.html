			<h3>
			MUSE is UCLA’s first undergraduate journal publishing student work in music scholarship. A student-run organization, MUSE aims to allow undergraduate students an outlet to share their academic work with a broader public.
			<br><br>Our goal is to publish scholarship over a wide range of music-related subjects, including but not limited to disciplines such as historical musicology, ethnomusicology, music analysis, popular music, sound studies, pedagogy, performance studies, critical theory, aesthetics, gender and sexuality, and cultural studies.
			<br><br>MUSE publishes a general issue once per year during UCLA’s Spring Quarter. Occasionally, MUSE will publish a special issue alongside the general issue; a special issue might include a collection of essays that focus on a specific topic or area of scholarly inquiry, or might showcase recent undergraduate work from UCLA’s School of Music, such as student capstone projects. 
			<br><br>Submissions to MUSE are open to any undergraduate student regardless of institution, major, or course of study.
