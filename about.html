			<h3>
			<i>MUSE</i> is an undergraduate academic journal publishing student work in music scholarship. A student-run organization at UCLA, <i>MUSE</i> aims to allow undergraduate students an outlet to share their academic work with a broader public.
				<br><br>
Our goal is to publish scholarship over a wide range of music-related subjects, including but not limited to disciplines such as historical musicology, ethnomusicology, music analysis, popular music, sound studies, pedagogy, performance studies, critical theory, aesthetics, gender and sexuality, and cultural studies.
				<br><br>
<i>MUSE</i> typically publishes a general issue once per year in the Spring and hosts an annual conference toward the end of the Spring quarter. We have a limited number of spots available on our Editorial Board and Marketing Team and welcome applications from students of any major or course of study at UCLA.
				<br><br>
In following our mission values of making music scholarship more accessible to undergraduates and uplifting our peers, <i>MUSE</i> aims to uplift budding scholars and their works, innovate sustainable models of labor for full-time student-scholars, and rethink what “accessibility” and “inclusivity” can mean in academic publishing. We are continuing our unwavering dedication to cultivating interdisciplinary work, curating engaging events, driving rigorous scholarship, and expanding our reach. Following a more generative model, the <i>MUSE</i> team directly assists and mentors authors in formulating strong conference papers and presentations. From the editorial process to our paper selections, we aim to be cutting-edge, self-reflexive, empathetic, supportive, inclusive, and interdisciplinary; our diverse membership and the varied disciplinary backgrounds of our published authors have greatly inspired and informed the growth of our journal while paving the path for lasting friendships, superior mentorship, and innovative collaborations.
