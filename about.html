			<h4>About Us</h4>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<h3>Like we talked about today, we will be meeting every Tuesday at 3pm in the Seminar Room in the Music Library (located on the second floor in the back left corner). However, if there are any changes to this or any other important announcements, we will likely be posting them in the Facebook group, so please make sure you join that soon. We'll try not to be annoying.
			<br><br>
			Please also make sure to follow us on Spotify for playlists from our members, as well as a log of every song we listen to in our weekly listening meet-ups. If you'd like us to include a playlist that you curate yourself, please let us know and we'd be happy to do so. Please make sure to tell your friends about our playlists as well, even if they can't make it to the meetings. Keep in mind that a personally curated playlist is optional, but we highly encourage participation!
			<br><br>
			Last, but definitely not least, here is a link where you can sign up for a presentation. We highly encourage all our members to present a song during one of our meet-ups. There are very few guidelines and fairly low expectations; we want to listen to the music that you want to tell us about! You can tell us the story of how you found out about the group, or an interesting fact about how the piece was written, or tell us about how there's this moment towards the end of the song that you love-- it's all for the love of music. There are some more formal things about how we select the songs to listen to each week in the link, so good luck!</h3>
