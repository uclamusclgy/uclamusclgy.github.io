		<h3>The Electric Lady: A Revolutionary Image of Black Womanhood<br><i>Charley Hausknost</i></h3>
<h6>Janelle Monáe’s “Electric Lady” emotion picture (music video) is a celebration of womanhood and an expression of pure Black joy. The video is an outlier within the popular music industry’s output, which routinely dehumanizes and hypersexualizes Black women. These oppressive, archetypal portrayals, found across all mainstream entertainment, continue to control and commodify Black women’s bodies; and contribute to the formation of what Patricia Hill Collins calls “controlling images.” With the rise of hip-hop feminism in the 1990s, Black women began reclaiming these images by expressing their own sexuality and body on their terms. However, recent discourse has questioned whether this form of resistance is truly empowering or, rather, maintains the oppressive, white-patriarchal structures it opposes. This essay shines a light on alternative forms of resistance as it explores the way Janelle Monáe broadcasts an image of Black femininity that is nuanced, joyful, and rooted in communal experience. Drawing on Kyra Gaunt’s ethnographic study that explains how Black rhythmic sensibilities are physically embodied and learned from childhood—thus, illuminating the importance of “kinetic orality” in fueling a sense of cultural belonging across trans-diasporic communities—I explore how Black social dance present in “Electric Lady” reflects this phenomenon. Combined with Monáe’s treatment of lyric and multi-level narratives, her use of dance challenges archetypal portrayals of Black women by declaring they are not only sexy, but sophisticated, joyful, and electric.</h6>
		
		<h3>Female Agency in the <i>Chanson de Mal Mariée</i> Genre<br><i>Mary Shannon</i></h3>
<h6>This essay examines the case of female representation in the <i>chanson de mal mariée</i> genre of the <i>chanson de femme</i> of medieval Paris. The genre depiction of an unhappy wife seems to suggest a sense of sexual agency. Multiple theories exist concerning the origin of this genre, including the possibility of its creation as a fetishization by men. Alternatively, some suggest that the genre is based on women’s songs that pre-date notation. These theories present contrasting views in terms of agency for the female subject. In the rondeau, <i>Soufrés, maris, et si ne vous anuit</i>, the back and forth dichotomy between activity and passivity presents a conflicting view of agency on the surface. However, this representation becomes clearer in considering the masking of sexual agency under a guise of passivity in order to maintain social norms. In the motet, <i>Je me doi bien doloseir / Por coi m’aveis vos doneit / Docebit</i>, this agency is more apparent through the juxtaposition of the male and female perspectives. The reversal of stereotypical binary gender roles allows the female speaker to possess more independence and agency in both the text and musical lines. Through analyzing these various theories and musical works in the <i>mal mariée</i> genre, I hope to demonstrate that although the representation of women in the <i>mal mariée</i> genre can give a sense of sexual agency and independence to the female speaker, this representation often varies in its application and effectiveness.</h6>
		
		<h3>The Lavender Effect: Lavender Country and Queer Acceptance in Country Music<br><i>Spencer Slayton</i></h3>
<h6>Country music is a longstanding American genre of popular music that has become associated with displays of white, working-class masculinity and nationalistic ideals. This genre has remained largely heterocentric throughout its history. However, in 1973, Patrick Haggerty and his band Lavender Country released their self-titled debut album and displayed their queerness as a badge of honor, forging an uncertain path right through the heart of country music. Unabashedly queer, while remaining true to the sincere roots of the genre, Lavender Country provided a vital voice to the underrepresented queer fans and participants of country and western music. Lavender Country’s trailblazing displays of overt queerness presaged an abundance of contemporary representation, leading to adjustments in our views of social and genre boundaries and the limitations that have been put on queerness and country music. I explore the significance of Lavender Country for their brazen trailblazing status as queer country musicians, as well as the intersections of class, race, gender identity, and sexual orientation within the world of country music over the last 70 years that leads right up to the present, in which there is a steadily increasing amount of queer and marginalized representation within the genre.</h6>
		
		<h3>“The Detail of The Pattern is Movement”: Technology, Embodiment, and Ensemble Singing<br><i>Eva Stone-Barney</i></h3>
<h6>This paper explores the relationships between sound and the body in choral music, treating both choral singing and conducting as embodied musical practices and investigating the ways in which technologies have the potential to alter the relationship between singers and their bodies. The body is necessarily implicated in the physical production of the choral sound itself, on either side of the podium. Choral singers have always had to negotiate between a healthy, physically engaged singing body and a stylistically correct blended choral sound. As contemporary technologies are introduced to ensemble singing practice and performance however, the nature of the singers’ physical relationship to their body as an instrument changes. Through an investigation of Roomful of Teeth’s use of the microphone, Janet Cardiff’s work <i>The Forty-Part Motet</i>, and Eric Whitacre’s virtual choir, this article investigates these technologies and the potential they have to affect choral singing as an embodied practice.</h6>
		
		<h3>Pastoralism, Loss, and Nostalgia: Vaughan Williams’s <i>The Lark Ascending</i> as an Elegy for Environmental Disruption<br><i>Kirsten Barker</i></h3>
<h6>The idea that music embodies meaning is largely accepted and uncontroversial. However, the way in which this relationship is articulated is complicated and contributes to music’s ability to project different meanings, especially according to time and place. Such is the case with the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams’s romance for violin and orchestra, <i>The Lark Ascending</i> (1920). This work contains both musical and extramusical traits that can be interpreted as pastoral and nostalgic. Understanding how these meanings interact through time provides the opportunity for reinterpretation of the work in the present through an environmentally-oriented framework. Previous research regarding <i>The Lark Ascending</i> has specifically focused on aspects such as the work in response to the First World War, as well as potential symbolic relationships with George Meredith’s eponymous 1881 poem. The present study establishes <i>The Lark Ascending</i> as a quintessential pastoral work by virtue of its musical content. By considering the circumstances of the work’s creation as well as its subsequent reception, these pastoral traits are then reinterpreted as an expression of nostalgia. This understanding of the work’s nostalgia underpins a new, environmentally-oriented reading, one where a contemporary audience is asked to reflect on the emotional or existential distress caused by ecological loss and disruption, and the piece is heard as an elegy for environmental loss and impossible futures.</h6>
