		<h3>Grave-Digging Crate Diggers: Retro Fetishism and Fan Engagement with Horror Scores<br><i>Spencer Slayton</i></h3>
<h6>Over the last decade, a growing trend of retro fetishism has been percolating throughout much of the media we are consuming. Amidst a renaissance of films inspired by the golden age of horror and genre films in the 1970s and 1980s, filmmakers have been utilizing the stylistic touchstones of this era and many fans and musicians are also integrating, reinterpreting, or reimagining these themes. Breaking down the barriers between fan and creator, these musicians mine the sonic caves created by synth-based film composers from this era such as John Carpenter, Tangerine Dream, and Goblin to create imaginary scores for non-existent films or to rescore classic horror films with a fresh perspective. Additionally, many of these classic horror film composers have been reactivated into pop culture through this renewed interest, releasing new material and even performing their scores on expansive live tours. Retro fetishism within visual media and fan engagement is perfectly paralleled with the current resurgence of vinyl as a form of music listening or collection cultivation. Our contemporary digital landscape coupled with an increasingly fraught political climate reminiscent of the conservatism of the 1980s may be reinforcing this predilection. This glorification of older themes and mediums is reflected in the ways that we engage with media in both our consumption and our content creation. While horror films have many critics, the genre, and specifically its music, is experiencing a notable resurgence, and the dynamics between producers, content creators, and consumers are shifting.</h6>
		
		<h3>Callowness of Youth: Finding Film’s Extremity in Thomas Adès’s <i>The Exterminating Angel</i><br><i>Lori McMahan</i></h3>
<h6>The technological innovations that have birthed and cultivated the art of cinema have dramatically altered the expectations that directors, composers, and audiences have for visual and performance art forms that predate the Digital Age. This essay will examine Thomas Adès and Tom Cairn’s <i>The Exterminating Angel</i>, a contemporary opera based on the 1962 surrealist film of the same name by writer/director, Luis Buñuel. The essay begins with a brief outline of opera’s relationship with film by examining <i>The Exterminating Angel</i>’s most prominent musical and dramatic extremities, as well technical demands. By way of this analysis, this essay draws attention to technology’s greater influence on classical art forms in the postmodern era and reveals an answer to an important question: in a late stage capitalist-consumer society where the stakes of art patronage run high, is an opera like <i>The Exterminating Angel</i> the exception? Or the new rule?</h6>
		
		<h3>The <i>Narcocorrido</i> as an Ethnographic and Anthropological Lens to the War on Drugs in Mexico<br><i>Samantha Cabral</i></h3>
<h6>Music has played a significant role in Mexican culture since the formation of its identity in the early 1500s. Such music has included themes of pueblo and rural life, as well as love and true stories of tragedy, known as corridos. In recent years, drug smugglers and mafias have started using <i>corridos</i> to glorify crime and violence — formulating what are now known as <i>narcocorridos</i> or “drug ballads.” Youth and mainstream culture embracing this music has given rise to a major cultural shift in Mexico; namely, a shift from a pious, bucolic society  to one marked by desperation and anarchic violence. This paper will analyze narcocorrido music as an indicative lens of particular social, political, economic, and cultural aspects of modern Mexico. I will delineate how narcocorridos are symptomatic of the uprising narco regime and their conjointly nihilistic culture. Considering various factors at play, I illustrate the extent to which we can actually attribute narcocorridos to the mafia culture and the extent to which they are merely telling of an anguished people deprived of peace, justice and freedom. Through the ethnographic analysis of narcocorridos, I seek to inform and foster a better understanding of the Mexican people and illuminate their present predicaments.</h6>
		
		<h3>This Is Our Story: The Fight for Queer Acceptance in <i>Shrek the Musical</i><br><i>Clarina Dimayuga</i></h3>
<h6>The uphill battle for acceptance fought by the fairytale characters in <i>Shrek the Musical</i> made timely parallels to the fight for same-sex marriage during the show’s premiere in 2008. In comparing this on-stage struggle to its real-life context, this essay demonstrates the ability of theatrical performances to instill aspirations for an optimistic future, especially in LGBTQ audiences. An analysis of the orchestration, lyrics, and visual content of the musical numbers “What’s Up Duloc?” and “Freak Flag” tie these performances to the groups on opposing sides of the same-sex marriage discourse, making the fairytale creatures’ eventual victory over Farquaad a representation of desired real-world triumph. This paper also addresses appropriation as a form of marketing, as marginalized groups such as the LGBTQ community are often vulnerable to these media practices. Although time has passed since the federal legalization of same-sex marriage, I argue that this fight for acceptance and the need for media that promotes these feelings of hope continues to be relevant today.</h6>
		
		<h3><i>Cats</i>: Culturally Significant Cinema<br><i>Liv Slaby</i></h3>
<h6>The 2019 film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s <i>Cats</i> represents a critical and box office disaster and, for some viewers, a celebration of ridiculousness. Fans act as textual poachers, reinterpreting the film as producers fail to control meaning-making. While scholarship typically positions notions of taste, fandom, and camp through polarities, I propose that <i>Cats</i> fandom draws these ideas into a conversation that questions the stability of their internal oppositions. This phenomenon evokes an intertextual framework of fan practices around musical theater, movie musicals, and cult films — forms especially conducive to active audience performance. This paper argues that such engagement employs a queer aesthetic frame and constructs critical play spaces wherein viewers camp <i>Cats</i>. Through playful camp performances, fans negotiate the boundaries between good taste and bad taste, as well as fandom and anti-fandom. I cite Fabio Cleto’s metaphor of camp as a party to discuss how fans construct systems of inclusion and exclusion to claim cultural capital. Fans of <i>Cats</i> produce dialectical readings from oppositional cultural concepts, subversively rewriting a notorious flop.</h6>
