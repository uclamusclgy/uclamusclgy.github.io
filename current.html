		<h3>The Historical Context and Characteristics of Beethoven’s Late Compositional Period<br><i>Becca Hanson</i></h3>
<h6>It was not the passive hand of fate that guided Beethoven to compose the sublime works of his late period from 1813 to 1827, but the active influences of the historical context of sociopolitical and personal factors. In this essay, the political aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars will be discussed, in particular the impacts of European victories over Napoleon Bonaparte and the influence of the Congress of Vienna. Through the orchestral work <i>Wellington’s Sieg</i> and the opera <i>Fidelio</i>, relationships among the historical context, Beethoven’s political awareness, and the composer’s engagement with sociopolitical ideologies will be explored. Beethoven’s social isolation and family situation will be included as a part of this context. Lastly, the stylistic distinctions of the late period from his first and second compositional periods, including the centrality of lyricism, more character-focused variation form, and expanded contrapuntal and fugal writing, are explored through discussion of some of his late piano sonatas and a late string quartet.</h6>
		
		<h3><i>Kolombia</i>: An Exploration of the Cumbia Subculture in Monterrey<br><i>Jesus Gutierrez</i></h3>
<h6>The music fandom of <i>Kolombia</i> with its fans wearing distinct ropa tumbada (baggy clothing) with gelled sideburns from Monterrey, Mexico took the Colombian musical aesthetics of cumbia music and created their own identity by constructing their own traditions as well as customs within the realms of cumbia. This paper looks at <i>Kolombia</i> through the lens of Henry Jenkins’s, an American fan studies scholar, <i>textual poaching</i> concept, which references the ways fans take and interpret a piece of text. Through interpreting the text, it creates an identifiable participatory culture by the distinct ways the fans interact with it and create their own community with the text. <i>Kolombia</i>, during its peak in the 1990s and 2000s, demolished the hegemonic Mexican societal culture by not conforming to its values of a polished citizen as well as, ironically, not conforming to the rise of the glorification of organized crime and violence. Though the <i>Kolombia</i> subculture was almost dissolved due to police brutality as the fans were profiled by the way they dressed and by the cartels, <i>Kolombia</i> has continued to survive in Monterrey as its love for Colombian cumbia music has endured. <i>Kolombia</i> is much more than a fan culture but a state of mind that uses the participatory nature of listening to cumbia music to bring a source liberation for the disenfranchised youth in Monterrey.</h6>
	
		<h3>Electric Avenue: Cultural Hybridization in Guyana and the Creation of Ringbang Music<br><i>Bridgette Kontner</i></h3>
<h6>The Caribbean is one of the most diverse regions on the planet, with its history of colonialism forcing the interaction of a myriad of cultures, namely African, East Asian, and European. Perhaps one of the most unique products of this cultural melting pot takes the form of music; specifically, a genre created in Guyana called <i>ringbang</i> music. Stylized in 1994 by Guyanese “Electric Avenue” songster Eddy Grant, ringbang was the fusion of all Caribbean musical styles, with a larger focus on rhythm over melody. This paper explores the concepts of <i>cultural hybridization</i> and <i>glocalization</i> in Caribbean music, and how they led to the origin of ringbang music. Cultural hybridization is a term that refers to the process of multiple cultures meeting and subsequently coexisting, complementing, and influencing one another, instead of one overtaking the others. Glocalization refers to the spreading of culture around the world, but in a way that is different from globalization. Instead of existing in a homogeneous fashion in every region, as globalization describes, those same pieces of culture interact with the respective cultures in each destination and in turn, manifest as unique and different in every place. When applied to this case study, one can see that ringbang music is essentially the glocalization of all Caribbean music, which in and of itself is already extremely hybridized music with African, Indian, Asian, and European influences.</h6>
		
		<h3>The Sounds of <i>Divoká Planeta</i>: A Science Fiction Film Score’s Portrayal of Post-Thaw Czechoslovakia<br><i>Minnie Seo</i></h3>
<h6>There were very specific circumstances —both geo-politically and economically— that surrounded the creation of <i>Divoká Planeta</i> (1973) — <i>La Planéte Sauvage</i> in French and <i>Fantastic Planet</i> in English. During the era of the Soviet Union, the time in which the film was made, censorship of art led many creatives —in this case filmmakers— to implement double-meaning in their work. If a Soviet artist wanted to criticize their government in a way that was deemed unacceptable by the regime, filmmakers would have to find another way to say what they meant, which entailed finding another approach that would give their work different interpretations to avoid persecution: this is double-meaning. At the same time, other countries could export their work to be done inexpensively in the Soviet Union. In this case, French director René Laloux collaborated with the famous Jiří Trnka Studio in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where the cost of animating was actually cheaper than in non-Soviet Union European countries. The film shows a very strange planet where humans are akin to rodents referred to as “Oms” (derived from <i>homme</i> in French meaning man), used and played with like pets for huge blue creatures with red eyes named “Draags.” The soundtrack is equally bizarre, featuring two prominent motifs: an ascending motif that represents the Draags, independence, and power and a descending motif that carries loss, devastation, and subjugation— usually this one is heard in association with the Ohms. The music of the <i>Divoká Planeta</i> (1973) calls the viewer to look deeper into the subtle insurrectionist themes of the film and view the conflicts of this strange planet to be not as other-worldly as they might think.</h6>
		
		<h3>Marginalized Practices: The Alexander Technique and Music Education<br><i>Cristian Toro</i></h3>
<h6>This paper analyzes how proponents of the Alexander Technique built credibility for the acceptance of the method in scientific and educational institutions. I consulted a scientific journal which contains an overview of the state of physical medicine in twentieth-century Britain and details of relevant scientific experiments. In addition, I examined the rhetoric utilized by medical professionals in correspondence published by the British Medical Journal and a litigation that took place in the Supreme Court of South Africa in 1948. The findings show that the technique and its practice were denounced by various medical authorities for several years. It was not until a scientific experiment found the method’s effectiveness to be superior to that of other postural regimens that the Alexander Technique began to be taught in colleges. This study demonstrates the power of scientific evidence to determine the contents of academic curriculums despite the ambiguity and limitations of scientific methodologies.</h6>
