					<h4 style="padding: 2vw 0vw 1vw 0vw">Submission Instructions</h4>
					<h3 style="padding: 1vw 2vw 1vw 2vw"><i>MUSE</i>, an undergraduate music studies journal at UCLA, is accepting presentation proposals for its 5th annual conference and special issue of conference proceedings (Vol. 5, No. 1). This conference aims to allow undergraduate students, independent scholars, and early graduate students in their first year of study to share their academic work with a broader public, establish mentorship networks, obtain feedback from peers, receive authorship credit, and cultivate inter-institutional connections while deepening knowledge of the discipline and making contributions to musicological discourse. Scholars are invited to present in a wide range of methods, including lecture demonstrations, panels, individual papers, performances, and more.

<i>MUSE</i> has showcased scholarship over a wide range of music-related subjects, including but not limited to historical musicology, ethnomusicology, music analysis, popular music, sound studies, pedagogy, performance studies, critical theory, aesthetics, gender and sexuality, and cultural studies. Proposals of any topic that critically engage with music and sound are welcome; presentations that employ interdisciplinary approaches are especially encouraged. We are hoping to host in-person panels at UCLA while accommodating hybrid/online panels where we can. 
						
Conference proposals are due by December 23, 2023 and should range between 250-500 words. In addition to hosting a conference, <i>MUSE</i> will be publishing proposals in a special edition of conference proceedings in our journal, along with the presenter’s name, bio, institutional affiliation, and preferred email. If selected, you will be contacted via email regarding the conditions of your acceptance, any additional deadlines, as well as conference logistics.

All submissions should be sent via email attachment (Word, Google Doc, or PDF) to musejournalsubmissions@gmail.com with the author’s name, presentation title, and institutional affiliation (if applicable) in the body of the email. For more information, please contact uclamusejournal@gmail.com with any questions.</he>
