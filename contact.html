					<h3 style="padding: 1vw 2vw 1vw 2vw">MUSE accepts submissions on a rolling basis; any essays received after the mid-January submission deadline will be considered for the next issue. If selected, you will be contacted via the email provided. MUSE only accepts submissions from students currently in undergraduate programs, or from those who have graduated within the past twelve months and have not yet begun graduate study. <br> **The deadline for submissions to the 2023 general issue is January 21, 2023.** <br> Submitted documents should be in the form of a Word or Google document (no PDFs). In order to help facilitate our blind selection process, please ensure that any identifying personal information from your document is removed. MUSE prefers essay submissions to be double-spaced, 12-point font, and in Chicago style (note-bibliography citation format). While MUSE does not have strict length guidelines for submissions, we generally look to publish essays ranging from around 3,000 to 5,000 words (excluding citations and bibliographic material). <br> All submissions should be sent via email attachment to musejournalsubmissions@gmail.com with the author’s name and institutional affiliation in the body of the email. If you have any questions concerning the submission process, please feel free to contact us at uclamusejournal@gmail.com.</he>
